Connecting Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) to an Amazon Cognito User Pool involves setting up OIDC (OpenID Connect) authentication. Here are the steps to connect EKS to a Cognito User Pool:

1. Create an OIDC Identity Provider:

Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
Open the Amazon EKS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/.
Choose your cluster.
In the navigation pane, choose "Configuration."
In the "Identity providers" section, choose "Add identity provider."
For "Provider URL," use the OIDC issuer URL of your Cognito User Pool. This URL follows the format https://cognito-idp.<region>.amazonaws.com/<YOUR_USER_POOL_ID>. Replace <region> and <YOUR_USER_POOL_ID> with your specific values.
For "Audience," use the App client ID of your Cognito User Pool app client.
Choose "Add identity provider."
2. Configure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):

Create an IAM OIDC identity provider for your cluster:

ruby
Copy code
aws eks create-cluster --name my-cluster-name --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-cluster-role --resources-vpc-config subnetIds=subnet-abc12345,securityGroupIds=sg-abc12345 --enable-oidc
Replace my-cluster-name with your EKS cluster name, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-cluster-role with the role ARN that you want to associate with your cluster, and subnet-abc12345 and sg-abc12345 with your VPC's subnet and security group.

Associate the OIDC identity provider with a Kubernetes service account:

arduino
Copy code
eksctl create iamserviceaccount --name my-service-account --namespace my-namespace --cluster my-cluster-name --attach-policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess --approve
Replace my-service-account, my-namespace, and my-cluster-name with your service account, namespace, and cluster names.

3. Update Your Kubernetes Configuration:

In your Kubernetes deployment manifest, configure the oidc section of the kubeconfig file with the OIDC issuer URL and the client ID from your Cognito User Pool app client.

An example configuration looks like this:

yaml
Copy code
oidc:
  issuer-url: https://cognito-idp.<region>.amazonaws.com/<YOUR_USER_POOL_ID>
  client-id: <YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID>
4. Deploy and Test:

Deploy your application to EKS.
When users access your application, they'll be prompted to authenticate via your Cognito User Pool.
Your Kubernetes workloads can use the OIDC identity provider to verify user identities and permissions.
Please replace placeholders like <region>, <YOUR_USER_POOL_ID>, and <YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID> with your actual values. This process establishes a trust relationship between EKS and your Cognito User Pool, allowing EKS to authenticate users using Cognito's OIDC capabilities.
